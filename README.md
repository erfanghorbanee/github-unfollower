My GitHub homepage got real messy in these years that I couldn't keep track of my favorite users and their repos anymore. so I decided to write a script that unfollows all the users that are not following me back and have a fresh start. hope you'll find it useful too.

## Getting Started
To use this script you need a <b>GitHub Token</b> with permission to unfollow users. go to your GitHub settings from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and generate a new token. put it in the code and you're all set.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute in any way possible.
