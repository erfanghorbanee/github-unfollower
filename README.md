My GitHub homepage got so messy these years that I couldn't keep track of my favorite users and their repos anymore. so I decided to write a script that unfollows all the users who are not following me back and have a fresh start. I hope you'll find it useful too.

## Getting Started
To use this script, you'll need a GitHub Token with the necessary permissions to unfollow users. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub settings [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
2. Generate a new token with the required unfollow permissions.
3. Insert the generated token in the code.

You're all set! Run the script and enjoy a cleaner GitHub homepage.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute in any way possible.
